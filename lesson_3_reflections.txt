When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	A remote repository is useful for open-source (or any collaborative) projects where multiple editors 
	will be working on the same file. It would be difficult to execute such a project if the files were 
	stored on someone's local client.
	
	Another scenario where the convenience of a remote repository would be desirable is where the file editor(s)
	desire access to the project from multiple devices. Since a remote repository is stored online, it can be 
	accessed via any appropriate device with an internet connection and git installed.
