When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	A remote repository is useful for open-source (or any collaborative) projects where multiple editors 
	will be working on the same file. It would be difficult to execute such a project if the files were 
	stored on someone's local client.
	
	Another scenario where the convenience of a remote repository would be desirable is where the file editor(s)
	desire access to the project from multiple devices. Since a remote repository is stored online, it can be 
	accessed via any appropriate device with an internet connection and git installed.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	The new commit on the remote might be by another user, and you may want to review the changes before pulling them to your local repository. There might also be a discrepancy between branches if new commits on either repository branched off - you might want to review these manually before pulling.
